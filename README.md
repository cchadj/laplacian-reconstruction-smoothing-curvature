# Run Project

This code was run at Google Collab:

```
> upload the .ipynb file to Google collab.
> Create a .zip file with the meshes with the following structure:
	meshes.zip
		> meshes/
			>example_meshes
					>...
			>demo-meshes
					>...

			>cow_small_manifold2.obj
			>bumpy_cube-small.obj
			>bumpy-bube.obj
> Upload "meshes.zip" to the files in the google collab session running the Coursework_2.ipynb
